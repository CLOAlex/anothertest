Welcome to CLO API Documentation!
=================================

This document describes how to download, install and use CLO API/SDK and
how developers can implement their own plug-ins running on CLO. It also
includes the simple structure for API/SDK package and addresses for the
sample projects in the package.

As CLO S/W has been developed for cross-platforms: Windows and Mac OS,
you can use the API/SDK package to make plug-in .dll and/or .dylib for both
platforms.

They have commonalities but some parts are different. Will describe the
common parts and different parts respectively.
